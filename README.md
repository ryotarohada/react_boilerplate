## Features Directory

In this template, the `src/features` directory divides directories for each feature (feature).

A single feature is concerned only with its own responsibilities and not with those of other features.

### When depend on a single feature

If you create a component, hook, or util that depends on a single feature, create it in `features/xxx/`.

For example: `features/auth/components/SomeComponent`, `features/auth/hooks/useSomeHook`, etc.

### global components

Components that exist under `src/components` are intended for global use.

There are several types of global components, each with a different role.

#### elements

Generic components in `src/components/elements/`.

This is the case when the component is not dependent on any features and is responsible only for building the UI.

Component granularity does not matter under `elements/`, so `Button` with a single element, `Dialog` with multiple elements, etc. will be aligned in parallel.

#### layouts

Components for building layouts in `src/components/layouts/`.

They are not complete by themselves, but are responsible for building the framework.

Must be passed `child` as props.

#### providers

Components for building contexts in `src/components/providers/`.

It is responsible for constructing contexts containing arbitrary states and propagating them down the tree.

#### shares

Components for sharing between features in `src/components/shares/`.

Basically, features are not involved with each other, but there are cases when you want to share components between features.

In such cases, shared components can be used.

â€» In such cases, there is a clear difference from `elements` components in that they depend on features.
